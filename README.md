Fifth project for the Treehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Techdegree. An application that for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. This application makes an AJAX call to a [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/) and display the response on the page. When the image or name is clicked a modal window is clicked with more detailed information, such as the employeeâ€™s birthday and address.

I have added A modal toggle so that you can easily move between users info and a search bar that searches the users on the page. I have also added my own background colors to make it my own.
